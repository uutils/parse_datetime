//! > The explicit mention of a day of the week will forward the date (only if
//! > necessary) to reach that day of the week in the future.
//! >
//! > Days of the week may be spelled out in full: ‘Sunday’, ‘Monday’,
//! > ‘Tuesday’, ‘Wednesday’, ‘Thursday’, ‘Friday’ or ‘Saturday’. Days may be
//! > abbreviated to their first three letters, optionally followed by a
//! > period. The special abbreviations ‘Tues’ for ‘Tuesday’, ‘Wednes’ for
//! > ‘Wednesday’ and ‘Thur’ or ‘Thurs’ for ‘Thursday’ are also allowed.
//! >
//! > A number may precede a day of the week item to move forward supplementary
//! > weeks. It is best used in expression like ‘third monday’. In this
//! > context, ‘last day’ or ‘next day’ is also acceptable; they move one week
//! > before or after the day that day by itself would represent.
//! >
//! > A comma following a day of the week item is ignored.
